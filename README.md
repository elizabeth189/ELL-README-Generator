## Description

This application was created to help facilitate building a functional README.md file. A proper README.md is important to accompany your project to allow users to understand your project. A README provides a description, important installation steps, instructions on usage, credits, and a license. This README generator provides that information and more to help users create their own README file! I was able to utilize node.js and inquirer to help make this application functional. 


## Installation
Clone the following files: 
-index.js
-generateMarkdown.js

-.gitignore
